        <p>Las Vegas is the closest airport to Southern Utah so we all flew in there and met up to begin our advetures! 
       We ended up going to get late night ice cream on The Stripe which was a lot of fun. Slept in a hotel, 
       eager to start our camping adventure the next day!</p>

    <h2>Day 2 - Zion National Park: The Emerald Pools Trail</h2>
        <img src = "ZNPS1.jpg" alt = "Entrance of Zion National Park" height="400" width="600" class="center">
        <p>We got up bright and early on Saturday morning to pick up everyting we needed to before heading 
            off to Zion National Park. We rented nearly all of our camping equipment including sleeping pads,
            kitchen gear, a stove and a tent. We got all of our gear from an awesome company called Basecamp Gear Rentals
            who are located only a few miles from the airport. After picking up all of that we headed to Walmart to grocery
            shop. We picked up lots of hardy food for our days of hiking and camping and hit the road. The funniest part of 
            this grocery shopping trip was when we realized that we needed more ice. I called one of my friends who was still 
            in the store and asked him to pick up an extra bag only to have him show up minutes later with a giant bag of rice...
        </p>
        <p>After stopping at a delicious Turkish food stand for lunch we hit the road to Utah. It took us about 3 hours to get
            from Vegas to Zion National Park. When we finally arrived at Zion it was around 2pm and we hopped on a shuttle and started
            our first hike of the trip: The Emerald Pools Trail. This was a great hike to start on because it was fairly easy and there
            were lot of opportunities for gorgeous photos.

    <h2>Day 3 - Bryce Canyon National Park</h2>
        <img src = "BCNPS1.jpg" alt = "Las Vegas Airport sticker." height="400" width="600" class="center">
        <p>Bryce Canyon far exceeded my expectations. On the southwestern corner of Utah, 
            Zion National gets all of the attention and all of the hype. Little did I know that 
            Bryce Canyon would be absolutely gorgeous! We met some friends there and ended up running 
        into a friend from STL which was such a suprise. </p>

    <h2>Day 4 - Zion National Park: Angel's Landing</h2>
        <img src = "ZNPS2.jpg" alt = "Las Vegas Airport sticker." height="400" width="600" class="center">
        <p>Wow this one was a doozy! I was very nervous about doing this hike but knew I would regret it
            it I came all the way here and didn't do this infamous hike. There is an infamous 1.1 mile
            "chain section" where you must hold onto chains on the side of the mountain to avoid falling off. It was a stressful 45ish
            minutes traversing this section (especially with 2-way traffic) but the view at the top was well worth it. I loved that there were 
            people of all ages from preteens to athletic looking retired folks.</p>

    <h2>Day 5 - Zion National Park: The Narrows</h2>
        <img src = "ZNPS3.jpg" alt = "Las Vegas Airport sticker." height="400" width="600" class="center">
        <p>This was a beautiful river hike but it was cold! Because we were in a canyon there was little sunlight.
            I opted to wear shorts which was convenient but during some of the deeper sections I felt frostbitten.
            I got many looks of pity from fellow hikers.
